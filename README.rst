Xi IoT - Getting Started with Data Pipelines
--------------------------------------------

Introducing Data Pipelines
###############################

In the Xi IoT platform, Data Pipelines are paths for data that include:

-  **Input**. An existing data source or real-time data stream.

-  **Transformation**. Code block such as a script defined in a Function to process or transform input data.

-  **Output**. A destination for your data. Publish data to the cloud or cloud data service (such as AWS Simple  Queue Service) at the edge.

They also enable you to process and transform captured data for further consumption or processing.
Data pipelines have the following components used in the examples in this lab:

-  Data Sources (defined as MQTT in this guide)

-  Runtime Environments

-  Functions
