WELCOME TO THE XI IOT TRIAL
###########################

   The Xi IoT trial is a limited-time trial, ready-to-deploy
   implementation of the Xi IoT Internet of Things edge computing
   platform. The Xi IoT Trial provides pre-built applications and data
   connectors hosted on its own infrastructure. This instant
   architecture demonstrates how to quickly deploy IoT and edge
   computing apps in the cloud.

   Nutanix has already created the basic infrastructure you need to get
   started.

   **What's In the Xi IoT Trial?**

1. Xi IoT management console, which provides the base for your Xi IoT
   trial.

2. A Starter project that includes:

   -  You (the project user).

   -  Xi Edge stack, connected and ready to go: no cluster or bare-metal
      resources required on your part.

   -  YouTube application, just waiting for your YouTube video URL.

   -  Xi IoT smartphone app, if you want to use your own video instead
      of YouTube.

..

   **What Can I Do with the Xi IoT Trial?**

-  Stream video from YouTube video or your smartphone to the Xi Cloud
   edge.

-  Automatically run containerized apps at the edge to perform object
   recognition on your video.

-  Stream the results back to the Xi IoT console or your smartphone,
   with recognized objects highlighted in your video.
